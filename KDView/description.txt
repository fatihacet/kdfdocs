KDView inherits KDObject. It's the basic class for all gui classes in KD Framework.

It basically creates a DOM that can be modified programatically. It's the base class of all KD* related view.
Each of the views can interact with each other, that means they are capable of sending and receiving events from each other.
You can therefore delegate certain task to certaing views.
The interaction is based on Delegation pattern.
The whole concept about this delegation pattern is done via the KDEventEmitter.
